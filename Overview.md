# The Project

In the academic year 2016/17, students from the University of Manchester worked on a project ran by UKSEDS to design and build 
a lunar rover. The objectives being to produce a preliminary design report, followed by a critical design report which was 
then defended in an interview with system engineers at Thales Alenia. Finally, upon being passed at each of these stages, the 
project was given funding to build the designed rover and take it to a competition at RAL Space.
