## Organisation of Information and Work

Information and work regarding the lunar rover project has been organised thusly:

Overview, overall design and discussion are in [this repository](https://github.com/MANSEDS/Lunar-Rover-2017), with detailed discussion in its wiki. All the code related to sensors as well as documentation on how they work is in the [sensors repository](https://github.com/MANSEDS/Lunar-Rover-2017-Sensors) and its associated wiki. The same goes for the [control interface](https://github.com/MANSEDS/Lunar-Rover-2017-Control-Interface), the [control backend](https://github.com/MANSEDS/Lunar-Rover-2017-Control-Backend), and the [robotics](https://github.com/MANSEDS/Lunar-Rover-2017-Robotics).

Where appropriate, CAD assemblies, finished-product images and links to third-party materials are provided. Code is fully documented and has been modified since the competition to fully realise the initial design and to be as easy to use and extend as possible.
